ABOUT ME:

I have 2 completed Frond-End Development courses, a lot of self-study and interest. 

I'm result oriented and attentive person, razer responsive and responsible. I have a high level of aesthetic intelligence, perseverance, a lively mind and a sense of tact. I love and know how to learn.

I respect views and values of other people and do not tolerate discrimination. The most important things for me are healthy communication, an engaged team and an opportunity to develop my skills. I am not indifferent to the quality of the product. I would like to be a part of a company where everyone is focused on a really cool result.

Previously, I realized myself as:
* Professional photographer
* Bartender
* Barista
