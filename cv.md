## ABOUT ME:

I have 2 completed Frond-End Development courses, a lot of self-study and interest. 

I'm result oriented and attentive person, razer responsive and responsible. I have a high level of aesthetic intelligence, perseverance, a lively mind and a sense of tact. I love and know how to learn.

I respect views and values of other people and do not tolerate discrimination. Important things for me are healthy communication, an engaged team and an opportunity to develop my skills. I am not indifferent to the quality of the product. I would like to be a part of a company where everyone is focused on a really cool result.

Previously, I realized myself as:
* Professional photographer (6 years experience)
* Bartender (3 years experience)
* Barista (3 years experience)

I did a lot of self-learning and got really inspired by the process of creating new products and communicating with different specialists. That experience taught me a lot and helped to develop my skills.
